# Bull's AI ðŸ“ˆ

Bull's AI is a powerful stock prediction application built with Python and Streamlit. It utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to forecast future stock prices based on historical data. The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can input a stock ticker symbol and visualize the predicted stock prices alongside various other insightful charts and statistics.

## Features

- **Stock Price Prediction**: Enter a stock ticker symbol, and Bull's AI will fetch the historical data and make predictions for future stock prices using a pre-trained machine learning model.
- **Predicted Price vs Original Price Chart**: View a line chart comparing the predicted stock prices with the actual historical prices, allowing you to assess the model's accuracy.
- **Data Description**: Get a detailed overview of the stock's historical data, including descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and quartile values.
- **Closing Price vs Time Chart**: Visualize the closing prices of the stock over time, enabling you to identify trends and patterns.
- **Closing Price vs Time Chart with 100MA**: Explore the closing prices along with the 100-day moving average, a popular technical indicator used in stock analysis.
- **Closing Price vs Time Chart with 100MA & 200MA**: View the closing prices with both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, providing additional insights for technical analysis.
